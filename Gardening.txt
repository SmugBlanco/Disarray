HM Forest -> Golden Sword Fern


Might remove the Golden Sword Fern as I want all the plants to serve a unique integral part to any playthrough
Having one be replaced in HM turns the original into a weed, which I dont think should happen.
Also, the replacement is lazy as it is just adding a 'Golden' prefix onto the regular plants.

Modelling Wiz's plants could be a good idea, seeing as how almost every plant is unique and serves a purpose. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Couch Potato -> Goto plants for basic healing pots and foods. 
Not exactly a fan of crafting potions? These babies have your problem solved!
They also drop a considerable amount of coins so it's a decent money option.

Cave Maize ( Name Required ) -> Goto plants for cavern ores and gems
Not exactly a fan of spelunking ( how ( HOW ) )? These have your problem solved!

Sword Fern -> Goto plants for combat related items
Easy source of Forge Materials and combat related utility items + tiles
Weaponry Drops -> 
The Pierce, increases armor penetration by 25
The Tank, hitting enemies increases damage reduction on next hit by 25%
The Pact, hitting enemies creates a pact; as long as you are not hit within the pact's duration you are healed for 1/10 of your health. Getting hit deals 1/10 of your health

Prickly Pear Bear -> Goto plant for ammunition related item

Things we dont want to intrude on: Fishing, Alchemy,
