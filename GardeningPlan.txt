Gardening -> Basically farming.
To get started: You obtain a plant's seed. This can be from destorying natural plants, collecting them, any method.
You then plant them on their suitable tiles.
Growth will be determined by a growth rate variable. Defaults to 1
Random updates will also have a chance to kill the plant if the requirements arent met. 
This can be mitigated by a Sturdiness variable. Defaults to 0
When harvestable you can right click to preserve the growth and get the labors of harvest
Alternatively you can break them at anystage and get their seed back, if its harvestable you'll also get the labors of 
harvest
Information on these plants will replace generic crop data.
We may get rid of daily trivia in favor of better crop data, this would be a +1 for me as i dont need to think of trivia
AND we get players the information they need to properly start their garden.

Gardener NPC? Sells clothing and accessories related to gardening and perhaps even some seeds?
