Borean Empire, an ancient empire which embodies the concept of greatness.

The Catacombs -> A prison complex housing Spider
Lore: Many millenias ago cabalists with allegiences to Spider killed the previous guardian in order to enter and free Spider
Raven enlisted the help of the Heir of the Borean Empire and his legions to enter and destory the traitors
However, Raven found another Guardian and not risking Spider's escape, forced the reclosure of the Catacombs trapping everyone in

Catacombs has two factions inside constantly repeating the same fight via memories
The Legionairres vs Cabalists vs Guardians ( Not really since they're a long gone force )
Legion most often outnumbered Cabalists and the fights end with them winning 
This fighting is only broken when the player interacts with them
